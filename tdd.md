Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?
To help parents spend some hard-earned time together while inside disney parks.
- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
We give parents access to high-quality applicants to ‘babysit’ their children while
roaming the parks.
- What is the mission statement?
Making disney for parents even more magical.
Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
Users can create an account as a babysitter or a person looking for a babysitter.
Both user types can create posts and the other user type can apply to the post. (I was thinking like indeed for babysitting) 
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
Add QR codes for each post. I could image disney having screens in the park that display a list of users that are willing to babysit. 
Reputability features.
Background checks?
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Indeed: They make it easy for job posters and users looking for jobs
Tinder: They make it very simple to find others.
Disney’s App: Makes it nice to have a location on their map.
Frameworks

- What 3rd party frameworks are you considering using?
Bcrypt, JWT. .NET after MVP is done for backend
- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access?
No
- Are you required to pay to use the API?
No
- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
Possibly Something like Mapkit
Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Parents at Disney parks.
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
No
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
No

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
